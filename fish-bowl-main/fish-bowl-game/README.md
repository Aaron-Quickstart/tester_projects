# Fish Bowl
### 4-12 players

# Game Rules
- separate into teams
- One team member (the actor) will hold the phone so the rest of his/her team (the guessers) can not see the screen.  The oposing team does not guess.
- The game will prompt the actor with a word and the rules on how to communicate that word. (ie  charades, one word only, etc)
- Each actor's turn will last 60 seconds, the actor may "pass" to see another word if the guessers can not guess correctly.
- Once each player has taken a turn, the round is over and a new rule is set.  Each round has unique rules.
- The word must be guessed exactly as it appears. (ie basket is not correct if the word on screen is baskets)
- Once a word has been guessed correctly it will be removed from the word bank for the other actors.
- The word bankk will reset for each round.
