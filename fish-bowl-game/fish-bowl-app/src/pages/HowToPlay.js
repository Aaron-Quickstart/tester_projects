                        To win, obviously. Or at least to look less foolish than your friends 
                        while shouting random nonsense and flailing like a caffeinated mime. 
                        The game combines wordplay, acting, and desperation into a glorious mess 
                        where you guess what in the world your friend is trying to communicate.
