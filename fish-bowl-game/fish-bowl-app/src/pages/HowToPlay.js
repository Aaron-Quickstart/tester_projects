                    <h3>Objective:</h3>
                    <p>
                        To win, obviously. Or at least to look less foolish than your friends 
                        while shouting random nonsense and flailing like a caffeinated mime. 
                        The game combines wordplay, acting, and desperation into a glorious mess 
                        where you guess what in the world your friend is trying to communicate.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Getting Ready for the Chaos</h3>
                    <p>
                        Split into two teams. If you‚Äôve got an odd number, someone‚Äôs the ‚Äúreferee‚Äù 
                        (aka the buzzkill who doesn‚Äôt play but judges your terrible acting).
                        Fishbowl has three rounds (plus a tie breaker if needed), each more outrageous than the last.  
                        Each round will have its own rule for how the actors can communicate.  
                        Every player will have a turn for each round.  Turns last 60 seconds.  
                        Awarded points increase for each round.  Fishbowl isn‚Äôt just a game‚Äîit‚Äôs a 
                        test of how long you can stand your friends before someone flips a table. 
                        Play hard, laugh harder, and may the best team (or the loudest) reign supreme.
