I broke it.  I will be trying to remake this game using React.
React may be easier as it is great for UIs

- Random spawn delay after each click
- colorblind modes
- add time limits for the squars to despawn and penalize the user
- more than one square spawns simultaniously or is visible on the screen at the same time.
